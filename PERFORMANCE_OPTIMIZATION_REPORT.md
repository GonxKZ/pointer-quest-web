## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Details

### Key Architectural Decisions:

1. **Centralized Managers**: AnimationManager, MemoryManager, InstancingManager provide singleton coordination
2. **React Integration**: Custom hooks abstract complex optimizations into reusable React patterns
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: WASM optimizations with JavaScript fallbacks ensure universal compatibility
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics enable proactive performance management
5. **Memory Safety**: Automatic resource management prevents common Three.js memory leak patterns

### Performance-Critical Code Patterns:

```typescript
// Optimized component with memo and custom comparison
const MemoryBlock = memo(({ block, position }) => {
  // Cached geometry and materials
  const geometry = getCachedGeometry(`box-${block.size.join('-')}`, 
    () => new THREE.BoxGeometry(...block.size));
  
  // Optimized animation registration
  useOptimizedAnimation(`memory-block-${block.id}`, animationCallback, priority);
}, customPropsComparison);

// Instanced rendering for similar objects
const { addInstance, updateInstance } = useDynamicInstancing(
  'memory-blocks', baseGeometry, baseMaterial, 100
);

// WASM-accelerated calculations
const { optimizedGeometry } = useWasmGeometry(originalGeometry);
```
